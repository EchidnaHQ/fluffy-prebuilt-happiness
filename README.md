# ðŸ¥° Fluffy Prebuilt Happiness ðŸ¥°
Fluffy pre-built packages of the GNOME stack for internal use within EchidnaHQ! 

## Why?
I honestly wish to encourage more people to contribute to [Echidna Code](https://github.com/EchidnaHQ/Echidna) and other projects that uses the GNOME stack. In the Linux ecosystem of open source projects, generally library developers don't provide pre-built packages for their libraries but only source tarballs, as those has been provided by distribution developers or the Flathub (if building code with [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/). However, that's not the case when we're talking about Windows or MacOS. This isn't really great for people who happens to not wishing to spend time compiling them, or can't, because of their hardware specifications.

I know on Windows, there's [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/), but they only provide packages built with Clang or MinGW, not MSVC, the preferred buildtools for building things on Windows. 

## Build Information
The Windows pre-built packages were built with [gvsbuild](https://github.com/wingtk/gvsbuild/) with default configurations on my lovely laptop. Unfortunately, gvsbuild does not support [reproducible builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/). There's [this issue](https://github.com/wingtk/gvsbuild/issues/200), but there were no comments nor activities.

At the moment, pre-packages for MacOS aren't available yet. You will have to [built themselves manually](https://www.gtk.org/docs/installations/macos/). ðŸ˜Š

## Installation

Just extract the lovely `gtk.zip` file from the [releases](https://github.com/EchidnaHQ/fluffy-prebuilt-happiness/releases) page to somewhere in your drive. Then [add the folder's location to the path](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/office/developer/sharepoint-2010/ee537574(v=office.14)#to-add-a-path-to-the-path-environment-variable).
